For this assessment you are to create the inside of a building that has been set by your project leader. You are to create a VR enviornment and give people the oppertunity to move around the building and interact with the different objects.

This assessment is made up of 2 milestones, a planning part and an execution part. 

This assessment is a group assessment and some restrictions are set around it.

* Each person person will be assigned a task that makes up a part of the bigger picture
* Each part will have an independant role, so every one can complete their task regardless of someone else
* All of the work as a team needs to have a unified look.

Note that this assessment will also test you on problem solving skills. You are to find a lot of the answers to the probelms that you are going to be faced with. This is part of your preparation of going into the industry.

**Milestone 1: Planning Report:**  

In this report you are to deliver a detail plan of what you are going to create. 

You are to create a detailed wireframe for your application and make it adaptable to your platform. 

Also create a section on the tools you are using and why. Note that for communication you need to use Slack you will get a slack channel assigned to your team.

The report will need to show the delegated role for each team member.

Each person needs to create an individual journal to show the progress they made as part of the team, what things they did to contribute to the team. The more detail the better. (Detail `!=` More words)

<br><br>

**Milestone 2: (Web) Application:**  

For this milestone you will hand in the demo of your tour of the building.
