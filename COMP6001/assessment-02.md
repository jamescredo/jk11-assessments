# Objective 
For this assessment you are to create an (web) application that allows you 
to draw information from a social media or google maps api.

This assessment is made up of 2 milestones, a planning part and an execution part. 

This assessment is a group assessment and some restrictions are set around it.

You have close to free reign what your application is going to look like.
* You may have several functions on a single page
* You may have several pages
* You must use an api to get data into your application
* You must divide up your application and delegate components to people in your group.
* Groups cannot be bigger than 4 people.

Note that this assessment will also test you on problem solving skills. You are to find a lot of the answers to the probelms that you are going to be faced with. This is part of your preparation of going into the industry.

<br><br>

# Resources

* You will be given a set of resources to look through, both for the assessment as well as the content of your chosen topic. 
* You will have all the class times to work on the assessments.

<br><br>

# Milestones

This Assessment has 2 milestones: 
* Milestone 1: Monday September 11th 2017 @ 4pm
* Milestone 2: Monday September 25th 2017 @ 4pm

<br><br>

**Milestone 1: Planning Report:**  

In this report you are to deliver a detail plan of what you are going to create. 

You are to create a detailed wireframe for your application and make it adaptable to your platform. 

Also create a section on the tools you are using and why. Note that for communication you need to use Slack you will get a slack channel assigned to your team.

The report will need to show the delegated role for each team member.

Each person needs to create an individual journal to show the progress they made as part of the team, what things they did to contribute to the team. The more detail the better. (Detail `!=` More words)

<br><br>

**Milestone 2: (Web) Application:**  

At this milestone, you application will be feature complete. Meaning that all the tasks you have listed will be completed by your team.

Each platform will have a learning curve as the execution will be different. 

The base minumum for each platform is:

* Choose an data api of an application
* Make your application viewable in multiple sizes according to the GUI principles of that platform.
* There is no need to store any data in the application
* Create an area in your application that lists what resources you have used.

| 3 <hr> Wireframes (30 marks)| **100** Clear idea of what the layout of your page(s) or app windows. Clearly show what happens to the content on the page when your layout changes. **50** The sketch of the layout is rough and would need to see the actual product before being able to confirm what the final result is. **0** No wireframe supplied or so unclear that it is not possible to see what part of the wireframe belongs where.  |
| 4 <hr> Tools (20 marks)| **100** Clearly show what tools you are using for your project. List a reason why you chose it and add the tutor to your team if possible. <hr> **50** Just using slack, that is all we need.

| 3 <hr>  Nice User Interface (30 marks)| **100** The interface of the application looks nice, good color combination, general layout, are the main items consistent, does the app provide a help section, good feedback to the user when the app crashes or does something unexpected. <hr> **50** Any 3 of the above criteria <hr> **0** None of the above criteria are met. |
| 4 <hr>  Match the wireframe (20 marks)| **100** The wireframe was a 100% correct when we planned it / Any changes are clearly documented. <hr> **50** The wireframe was part of the production, but not everything matches <hr> **0** No reference to the wireframe was made |

They are there in the app, but don't do anything. |

# How to hand in Submission

**Team Report**
The whole report is to be written in markdown and submitted through a git repository. This git repository will also be used for Milestone 2.

**Individual Report**
This section will be in a separate file and be submitted in a "fork" of the main report. This fork will also be used for your Asssessment 3 submission.

**Naming Convention**
Your repository is to be named C6002-ASSN2-T00 where 00 is the number you will be supplied.

Name the fork of the main report C6002-ASSN2-T00-IDNUMBER.

**Moodle Submission**
In the moodle submission there are 2 submission boxes:

1: Used for the team submission - **ONLY The TEAM LEADER is to submit your assessment.** If there is an issue with the submission or you don't trust your team leader, use the Slack Group Channel to paste the link in there as well.

2: This submission is used for the Individual Journal. **EVERYONE** needs to submit the link to their journal into this.
