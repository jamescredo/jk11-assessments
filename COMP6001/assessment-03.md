## Learning Outcomes

### Learning Outcome Three:
Design and develop a simple application of medium complexity to demonstrate the Graphical User Interface programming skills.

## Objective 
As part of making an application, you need to know how to improve on it. For this application you are to improve on 1 (one) bug and add 1 (one) feature from your group application.

## Milestones 

* This is a individual assessment and you are to improve on these aspects on your own. This might be a bug or a feature. 

* You are not allowed to fix the same bug or improve on the same feature as your team mates did. 

* You are to list your bug / feature as an issue on the main repository and create a branch from there. This will create the branch for you with the latest code.

* You need to test that the feature adss to the project or that the bug fixes the actual issue (no unit testing). 

* For each feature / bug you need to write up 100 words to explain what the improvement is.

* Merge your code into the main repository when you have completed your task. Note that the person who merges first will unlikely run into conflicts.
