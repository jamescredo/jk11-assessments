# COMP6001 GUI Programming
# Semester 17B

## Assessment 1
## Due Date: August 11th 2017 @ 4pm

### Submission: Git repository link pasted in Moodle
### Requirements: Knowledge of Learning outcome 1
---

# Learning Outcome One:
> Demonstrate the knowledge of Graphical User Interface programming conventions and standards.

# Objective
This assessment is part 1 of 3 and builds up to an application portfolio.
The idea is that you get a clear understanding of what the conventions are in your chosen module. Some have been discussed in class, but there are more.

# Things to hand in:
* Report about GUI best practices, written in markdown.
* Small application where you can change the background color in your app.

# Report on GUI best practises
This report is not about length in size - ie. no mimum amount of words.
This report needs to show research on what good practises are relating to a GUI in your chosen subject area.
For everything you find you will need to supply a reference. If there is no reference, you do no get the points. 

This section is worth 40% of the mark.
Each item you bring up is worth 10 points, up to a 80 (so 8 items)

Mark each point clearly using a new heading.
Use correct markdown syntax. For example if you need to dislpay code, type it in a code block.

**The last 20 points** are dedicated to peer review.
The points you write up in your report should be tested by someone who is **NOT DOING** your module.

This person, will need to add their comments and name your your report.

# Small Application changing background colour

This application simply requires you to create an interface that allows a user to change the background colour of a background.

You are able to use any GUI elements that are specifically right for your application. 

This module is worth 60% of the final mark.

You will be marked on the following:

* Apply the principles that you did your research on. (40%)
* Allow input from the user to adjust each of the 3 colours and click / tap a button that confirms the selection and then changes the colour. (20%)
* A reset button that makes the background color white (20%)
* Instructions for the user to show them how to use the application (20%)

# Marking Schedule

## PART 1:
* 80% - 8 points for each item you list - maximum of 80 (10 items)
* 20% - made up of points for the peer review section

## PART 2:
* 40% - Applying the points of your research in your application
* 20% - Input from the user to change the background color
* 20% - Allow for the user to reset the app back to default setting (White background)
* 20% - In app Instructions for user to use the application

**Everything should be submitted in a single repository and only the link to the repo should appear on the moodle submission**

Any other messages will cause you to loose points, if you need to explain something use slack to DM me or Jacob (if you are in the VR team)
