# Objective
This assessment each of your team members of assessment 2, needs to evaluate an project of another team. These reports are individually marked. You are to evaluate the website of another team in your class and critique them on the quality of the website and what you learned from their website as well as what you would suggest they do different in a future project.

Points to critique are the use of media files, layout, responsiveness and website structure.

Note that your report should not mention any names or attack a person, this is a evaluative feedback.

You will be given the github / bitbucket link to the repository. If this is not accessible by you, please DM me.

# Things to hand in:
* Talk about each points mentioned above
* Each section requires about 250 words
*Note that you need to know what each of them are to make a valid comment.*

# Marking Guide
Each section is worth 25% and are graded according to the following scale:

| Criteria | Marks |
| --- | --- |
| A single line of it looks good, a simple generic compliment or nothing submitted | 0 |
| A few lines on relevant points | 25 |
| Good description of things that do not work and good be improved on | 50 |
| Clearly describe what the issues are and be able to give feedback on how to improve on them | 75 |
| Clearly describe what the issues are and be able to give feedback on how to improve on them and add some links to specific references for the developer to look at | 100 |

# Deliverable

* Your report should be written in a Google doc and shared with jk11@bcs.net.nz
* Your report should be written in such a way that the original group / developer can request it to see what they have been critiqued on.

* NAME YOUR REPORT LIKE THIS:   9980349_JEFF_TEAM_X (where x is the group number of the website)

Note that if you Google doc is not shared, or accessible to me, you will loose 10% of the overal mark for me having to chase you up about it.
