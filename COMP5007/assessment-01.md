# Semester 17B

## Assessment 1
## Due Date: August 18th 2017 @ 4pm

### Submission: Git repository link pasted in Moodle
### Requirements: Knowledge of Learning outcome 1
---

# Learning Outcome One:
> 1. Understand why interactive and animated multimedia applications solve problems of low complexity.

# Learning Outcome Two:
> 2. Understand and use key design principles of text, graphical images, video, animation and sound for multimedia content.

# Objective
This assessment requires you to create a website according to the specifications given. Making use of the images and texts supplied.
Also in regards the knowledge of solving problems, a manual responsive created website is required.

# Things to hand in:
* Manual responsive version of the website
* Bootstrap version of website

# Manual Website:

You will be given the **content** for a particular website you have to create. The website's focus is not the content, but how you present it.

You are to use the skills you have learned so far about the different media types.

The end result is a website with a picture-qoute combination inside of a panel type frame.

You are able to use HTML and CSS - no javascript and no bootstrap.

Think about how to use the `:root` pseudoclass and the `@media` rule to create a responsive website.

# Bootstrap Website:

Create another website with the same resources and a similar look using the bootstrap framework.
You are free to customise some things, but your css file should be significantly smaller.

Use the classes of bootstrap to your advantage.

# Marking schedule

You can be awarded partial marks if you meet part of the criteria

# Notes:

It assumed to see regualr git commits and good planning of your website. For example designing some wireframes would really help you out and save time when it comes to coding. You are allowed to use the same layout for both websites.

# Submission:

You will need to submit the link to your repository through moodle.

* DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER COMMENTS WITH YOUR SUBMMISION. Any other comments need to be communicated through slack. Marks will be deducted if they are in the moodle submission box.

* YOUR REPOSITORY NEEDS TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY ME. You can either make it public or share it with `bcsjk11`. If I can't access the repo, then I cannot mark the assessment. I am not going to chase you for it.
