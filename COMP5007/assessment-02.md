# Milestones

This Assessment has 2 milestones: 
* Milestone 1: Monday September 11th 2017 @ 4pm
* Milestone 2: Monday September 25th 2017 @ 4pm

**Milestone 1: Planning Report:**  

In this report you are to explain what your work process will be, what resources you have found that you think will help.

Also draw out a wireframe of your design, you will need to create about 6 pages each with a different layout. Each of these pages need to have a desktop / tablet and a mobile layout.

Also create a section on the tools you are using and why. Note that for communication you need to use Slack you will get a slack channel assigned to your team.

The report will need to show the delegated role for each team member. 

**Milestone 2: Website execution:**  

For this milestone you as a team need to submit the web template you have created.

You are to have a common theme amongst your pages.
Create a template page for the following items:

* 100% single column main home page
* Profile page for people that work at a business
* Portfolio page, something that can showcase a persons work - just image placeholders.
* A contact page, add a map and other relevant details that a company could use
* A blog type page with the option for a header and a body of a paragraph
* A media gallery that has a slideshow or a lightbox feature and responsive videos

Any data you use needs to be dummy data, use `lorem ipsum` text and placeholder images.
If you get your images / videos from anywhere, make sure they are referenced on a page on your website. (This could be a page called resource.html and needs to be a part of your theme.)

The pages in your project need to be linked to each other.
